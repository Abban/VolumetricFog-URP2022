## Installation Using the Unity Package Manager
1. Open Window > Package Manager.
2. Click the little + symbol in the top left of the window and select "Add package from git URL".
3. Paste the git URL from this repository into the text box.

## Usage

1. Add the Volumetric Fog Feature to your URP renderer.
2. Add a Volumetric Fog component to an object in your scene.
3. Enjoy!

## To do:

* Add a *Rendering > Volumetric Fog* option to the GameObject menu
* Rendering layer support so not all lights have to affect the fog
* Change stepping to be exponential
* Should probably add more comments

Feel free to make pull requests with improvements!
